        Emory Andrew Tate III (born 1 December 1986) is an American and British social media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. He gained notoriety for promoting a variety positions in the manosphere community.[3] His controversial commentary has resulted in his expulsion from various social media platforms and concern that he promotes misogynist views to his audience.[4] As a divisive influencer,[5] Tate has amassed 9.9 million followers on X[6][7] and was the third-most googled person in 2023,[8] with most British adults aware of who he is.[9] He has been dubbed the "king of toxic masculinity",[10] and is politically described as both right-wing[11] and far-right,[12] and has called himself a misogynist.[13] As of August 2024, Tate is facing five legal investigations—three criminal and two civil—in Romania and the United Kingdom.[14][15][16]

        Tate first began to kickbox in 2005, winning several kickboxing titles in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2016, he appeared on the British reality series Big Brother, but was removed, as he was the suspect in an open rape investigation in the United Kingdom. The investigation was later dropped, but Tate was again suspected in 2024.[17] After his kickboxing career, Tate and his brother, Tristan, began operating a webcam model business, then sold online courses. With his audience from his courses, he became prominent as an internet celebrity promoting a hyper-macho view of masculinity.[18][19][20] Tate's courses include Hustler's University, which gained 100,000 subscribers and was later rebranded as The Real World, and the secretive War Room group, which the BBC has accused of coercing women into sex work and teaching violence against women.[21] In August 2023, it was estimated that Tate's online ventures generated US$5 million in revenue monthly.[22]
        
        In December 2022, Tate and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania, along with two women. In June 2023, all four were charged with rape, human trafficking, and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women. In July, two of their accusers reportedly went into hiding after a campaign of online harassment, and the Tate brothers filed a defamation lawsuit, claiming $5 million in damages against one of the accusers. In March 2024, British police obtained an arrest warrant for the Tate brothers as part of an investigation into rape and human trafficking. In July 2024, they began a civil case against the brothers and a third person for alleged tax evasion. In August, Romanian police raided four properties Tate owns and expanded its investigation to include trafficking minors, sex with a minor, money laundering and attempting to influence witnesses. Tate and his brother have denied all charges and allegations.
